    <h3>About Application</h3>
    <p>This application was made by student Karel Drnec as Bachelor thesis at 
    <a href="https://www.tul.cz/en/" target="_blank">Technical University of Liberec</a> in 2019. The topic of this thesis is Fault Tree Analysis
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tree_analysis" target="_blank">FTA</a>). The goal was to make a simple software working with FTA. This FTA software
    provides an easy work with analysis. User can build a diagram with 3 gate types (AND, OR, K/N) and basic events. Also, the diagram can be saved to a file,
    loaded from a file or exported to SVG/PNG.</p>
