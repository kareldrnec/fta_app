Users of this application can build a Fault Tree Diagram with:
  - basic events 
  - basic logic gates (AND, OR, K/N => k-out-of-n components)

Basic events have several types of input values:
  - Probability of a failure (P)
  - Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
  - Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)
  - Failure Rate (λ)
  - Repair Rate (μ)

FTA application can solve several types of analysis and display results in numbers or graph.
